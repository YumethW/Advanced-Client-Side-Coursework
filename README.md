# Advanced-Client-Side-Coursework
This client-side web application, built using HTML5 and React JS, enables users to search for properties based on various criteria, including type, price range, number of bedrooms, date added, and postcode area. The form utilizes React Widgets for enhanced UI components, ensuring consistency, reliability, and accessibility.

The application incorporates a JSON file containing property data, including two pre-existing properties and an additional five properties for a comprehensive search experience.

    Search Functionality : Users can search using any combination of criteria, with results displayed effectively, including property images, short descriptions, and prices.

    Property Details Page : Each property page features a large image, thumbnail images, short description, and the ability to view all property images using a chosen plugin.

    React Tabs : Utilizing React tabs, users can access the property's long description, floor plan, and Google Map.

    Favourites Management : Users can add properties to their favorites list through dragging or a "favourite" button. Removal options include dragging out or using a delete button. The favourites list can be cleared.

    Responsive Design : The search page, results page, and individual property details are responsive, with layouts adjusted for large screens and smaller devices. Hand-written media queries or Bootstrap ensure a seamless user experience.
